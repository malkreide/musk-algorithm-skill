## Origin: Elon Musk's 5-Step Algorithm

The 5-step algorithm was developed by Elon Musk at SpaceX and Tesla and is documented in Walter Isaacson's biography *Elon Musk* (2023). The methodology arose from the need to radically simplify and accelerate complex engineering processes.

### The Original Steps (Hardware Engineering)

1. **Make the requirements less dumb** — Question every requirement, especially those from "smart" people
2. **Delete** — Delete every part, process, or step that isn't absolutely necessary
3. **Simplify and Optimize** — Only simplify what remains after Step 2
4. **Accelerate** — Increase the speed of the process
5. **Automate** — Only automate once everything else is optimized

### Core Principle: The Sequence Matters

> "If you're not occasionally adding things back in, you're not deleting enough."
> — Elon Musk

The most common mistake in industry is applying the steps in the wrong order:

- ❌ **Wrong**: Automate first (Step 5), then optimize
  → Result: An efficient process that solves the wrong problem

- ✅ **Right**: Question first (Step 1), then delete (Step 2), then automate (Step 5)
  → Result: A process that only exists if it's truly necessary

## Adaptation for Public Administration

### Why Is Adaptation Necessary?

Hardware engineering and public administration differ fundamentally:

| Hardware Engineering | Public Administration |
|---|---|
| Errors are reversible (reinstall the part) | Decisions often irreversible (social/political consequences) |
| Success is measurable (product works/doesn't) | Success hard to measure (citizen satisfaction, equity) |
| Hierarchy-oriented (CEO decides) | Stakeholder-oriented (democratic legitimacy) |
| Speed = competitive advantage | Stability = trust |
| Iterative error culture ("Move fast, break things") | Risk-averse culture ("Duty of care") |

### What Was Adapted?

1. **Chesterton's Fence Principle** (added)
   - Before a rule is deleted, it must be understood **why** it was introduced
   - Prevents premature deletion of "invisible" safety mechanisms
   - Example: A seemingly unnecessary approval level protects minority rights

2. **Stakeholder Analysis** (mandatory sub-step in Step 2)
   - Hardware: A deleted component only affects the product
   - Administration: A deleted process affects people (teachers, parents, students)
   - Deletion decisions without stakeholder involvement are politically risky in administration

3. **Data Quality Indicator** (added)
   - Hardware: Measurable metrics (weight, cost, cycle time)
   - Administration: Often only estimates and experience values
   - Explicitly flag uncertain data (important for executive decisions)

4. **Legal Foundations as Framework Conditions** (added)
   - Hardware: "Dumb requirements" are often internal specifications
   - Administration: Laws/regulations are non-negotiable
   - Distinction: Legal obligation vs. internal habit

5. **Pilot Projects Instead of Full Rollout** (added)
   - Hardware: Test prototype, then scale
   - Administration: Test in one district, then roll out city-wide
   - Reduces risk for major organizational changes

## Theoretical Foundation

### Related Concepts

The Musk Algorithm combines elements from several management and engineering philosophies:

#### 1. **Lean Manufacturing** (Toyota Production System)
- **Muda elimination** (waste removal)
- **Kaizen** (continuous improvement)
- **Jidoka** (stop errors immediately)

**Relation to the Musk Algorithm:**
Step 2 (Delete) corresponds to Muda elimination. Both approaches prioritize removing waste before optimization.

#### 2. **First Principles Thinking**
- Return to fundamental truths
- Question analogies and conventions
- "What is physically/organizationally absolutely necessary?"

**Relation to the Musk Algorithm:**
Step 1 (Question requirements) is applied first-principles thinking.

#### 3. **Theory of Constraints** (Eliyahu Goldratt)
- Identify the bottleneck
- Optimize only the bottleneck
- Systems thinking instead of local optimization

**Relation to the Musk Algorithm:**
Step 4 (Accelerate) focuses on bottlenecks in the process flow.

#### 4. **Chesterton's Fence** (G.K. Chesterton, 1929)
> "Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place."

**Relation to the Musk Algorithm:**
Integrated as a safety valve in Step 2 in the administration adaptation.

## Why Does the Algorithm Work?

### 1. **Combats Addition Bias**
Humans tend to solve problems by **adding** rather than **removing**.

**Study (Nature, 2021):**
In experiments, 80% of participants preferred adding elements even though removal was more efficient.

**Example from administration:**
- Problem: Process takes too long
- Intuitive solution: Hire more staff
- Algorithm solution: Delete unnecessary steps

### 2. **Enforces Sequential Thinking**
The strict sequence prevents jumping to "favorite solutions."

**Without the algorithm:**
- User: "We need an AI tool for school enrollments"
- Risk: Automating a broken process (Step 5 before Step 1)

**With the algorithm:**
- Step 1: Do we even need all these enrollment steps?
- Step 2: Which ones can we delete?
- ...
- Step 5: Now deploy AI

### 3. **Makes Implicit Assumptions Explicit**
By uncovering the "authors" of requirements, legacy processes become visible.

**Example:**
- Requirement: "PDF forms must be in Arial 12pt"
- Origin: IT policy from 2009 (then: optimized for fax transmission)
- Today: Obsolete (no fax in use)
- Result: Requirement deleted

## Practical Application Examples

### Tesla Gigafactory (Original Context)

**Step 1 (Question):**
Musk asked: "Why does this robot station have a protective enclosure?"
Answer: "For worker safety."
Musk: "What workers? Only the robot works here."
→ Requirement was obsolete

**Step 2 (Delete):**
Protective enclosure was removed → 40% space savings in the factory

**Step 5 (Automate):**
Tesla tried to automate too early ("Alien Dreadnought" phase) → Production collapsed
→ Lesson: Stabilize manually first, then automate

### City of Zurich School Department (Adapted Context)

**Step 1 (Question):**
Question: "Why must school enrollments arrive by mail?"
Answer: "Data protection policy from 2015 (no cloud tools)"
Check: Is the policy still current? → Yes (Zurich Data Protection Act)
→ Requirement stays, **but** implementation can be simplified (on-premise form)

**Step 2 (Delete + Stakeholder Analysis):**
Deletion candidate: "Manual Excel data entry"
Affected: Administrative staff
Involvement: Workshop with staff → Training for new solution
→ Deletion approved

## Limitations of the Methodology

The Musk Algorithm is **not suitable for:**

### 1. **Creative Tasks**
- Brainstorming without an optimization goal
- Artistic/pedagogical processes without measurable efficiency

### 2. **Compliance-Dominated Areas**
- When 90% of requirements are legally fixed
- Example: Financial reporting (optimization is marginal here)

### 3. **Emergency/Crisis Situations**
- When quick decisions without analysis are needed
- Example: School closures during a pandemic

### 4. **Highly Political Decisions**
- When stakeholder consensus is more important than efficiency
- Example: Redrawing school district boundaries
